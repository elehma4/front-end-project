## Project Kickoff

* Front End Project start: __Tuesday, April 18th__.
* Front End Project presentation: __Friday, April 28th__.

## Description
* Your task is to build something awesome with your team!
* You'll be using the front-end skills you've developed over the last several weeks.
* Each team must present their project and each team member must have a presenting role.

## Technical Requirements
* Implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices.
* Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)
* HTML is well structured
* Javascript loads correctly and doesn't have any console errors

## Workflow Requirements
* You'll be working in [assigned groups](./GROUPS.md).
* Use agile methodolgy (daily standups)
* Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
  * Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
  * Reviewer must code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged. If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult to read spots, code review didn't happen.
* Use a feature tracking system, such as:
  * Github Projects
  * Trello

### Suggested PR rejection criteria
* Does not fulfill feature
* Breaks other feature
* Does not follow team's coding style/standards
* Too many files changed in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
* Code in a commit does not match commit message
* Commit message is vague

### Instructions for Demo

Each team will have ~10 minutes to demo their group project!
